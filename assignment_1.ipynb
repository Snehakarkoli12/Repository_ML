    "# **Use Case: Predicting Heart Disease Risk Using Machine Learning**  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Data**  \n",
    "Data is the foundation of any machine learning model. In this case, we need patient health records, medical history, and lifestyle details to predict the risk of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **a. Data Sources**  \n",
    "The data for heart disease prediction can come from multiple sources:  \n",
    "- **Electronic Health Records (EHRs):** Hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers maintain patient records.  \n",
    "- **Public Datasets:** Open-source datasets like the **Framingham Heart Study**, **Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset**, and **MIMIC-III**.  \n",
    "- **Wearable Devices:** Smartwatches and fitness bands provide real-time heart rate, blood pressure, and activity levels.  \n",
    "- **Surveys & Clinical Trials:** Government agencies like WHO, CDC, and research institutions collect data through health surveys.  \n",

    "### **b. Data Issues**  \n",
    "Healthcare data often comes with multiple challenges:  \n",
    "- **Missing Values:** Some patient records may lack crucial details (e.g., cholesterol levels, smoking history).  \n",
    "- **Imbalanced Data:** In real-world scenarios, the number of patients with heart disease is much lower than those without it, leading to biased predictions.  \n",
    "- **Data Privacy & Compliance:** Strict regulations like HIPAA (US) and GDPR (Europe) restrict how data can be used.  \n",
    "- **Noisy or Inconsistent Data:** Errors in manually entered health records can affect prediction accuracy.  \n",
    "- **Data Standardization:** Different hospitals may record the same parameter (e.g., blood pressure) in different formats."

    "  - Medical history (categorical data like \"Diabetic/Non-Diabetic\").  \n",
    "- **Unstructured Data:**  \n",
    "  - Doctorâ€™s notes, medical reports, and radiology images.  \n",
    "- **Time-Series Data:**  \n",
    "  - ECG signals, heart rate variations from wearable devices.  \n",
    "- **Geospatial Data:**  \n",
    "  - Location-based data showing regions with high heart disease prevalence. "
